# Classical ML Models 
By Qidu(Quentin) Fu

This repository stores the code for the classical machine learning models. The models are implemented from scratch. The models are implemented in Python 3.7.

## 1 Introduction and Projects
The models are implemented in the following projects:
- Project1: [linearRegression](linearRegression.py)
- Project2: [logisticRegression](logisticRegression.py)
- Project3: [neutralNetworkForBinaryClassification](nnForBinary.py)
- Project4: [neutralNetworkForMulticlassClassification](nnForMulti.py)
- Project5: [adviceForModelEvaluation](evaluateML.py)
- Project6: [trees](trees.py)
- Project7: [kMeans](kMeans.py)
- Project8: [anomalyDetection](anomalyDetection.py)
- Project9: [collaborativeFilteringRecommender](collaborativeFilteringRecommender.py)
- Project10: [contentBasedFiltering](contentBasedFiltering.py)


Note that the some helper functions are written in the [`utilsRegression.py`](utilsRegression.py) and [`utils2.py`](utils2.py) files. Please refer to the code and utils files for more details.
